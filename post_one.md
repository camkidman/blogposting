## ~~Quick~~ Introduction

In the event you don't know me personally, you probably don't know that I recently accepted an apprenticeship with a relatively well-known company in Utah: MX. This post is about my experiences so far!

The apprenticeship, according to [this link](http://www.mx.com/company/apprenticeships/), was meant for individuals who were just starting their software development careers, either from a 'dev bootcamp' or from their own self-taught skillset. The program was detailed to be 3 months, paid the equivalent of $14.50/hr, and promised the opportunity to work on a production codebase that served millions of requests per day. Anyone who's involved in the Utah Ruby community knows MX is doing some interesting things with their product, and taking their business in a spectacular direction.

Sounds interesting, right? So I applied!

My application, for the curious, can be found [here](http://cam.thefitdeveloper.com). I initially submitted my application in the third week of July, and was told that I was chosen for an interview! I went in two-ish weeks after that for said interview and it was quite an interesting experience! There were four potential apprentices (including myself), and a host of mentors and senior developers. Our task was to solve problems as a group. We were given a problem, we talked it out at length, then we had lunch with the interviewers and was sent on our way! 

I spent the next who-knows how long worrying about whether or not I came off too strong in my interview, didn't say enough, said too much, etc etc. Normal worries that you have when you're within grasp of a goal you've had for quite some time (now might be a good time to mention I applied at MX a few months ago but didn't fit the experience level they were looking for).

Who-knows how long later (less than a couple weeks), I was notified that I was selected for one of the apprenticeship positions!!!!! Oh **MAN** I was so excited!

## The Gravity of Choice
The apprenticeship was geared towards people who were relatively new to software development and coding, but that didn't really describe me when I applied. At the time, I had been working for a little SaaS company that I helped found and was doing double-duty as technical support and development; I've also been working on side projects for a couple years, so I may have been on the senior end of the candidates they were looking for. I applied because I wanted the experience that working on their codebase with their amazing staff could provide.

There were a few pros and cons when it came to taking the apprenticeship. Pros:

* I would get to work on, what I knew to be, an **awesome** codebase
* I would get to work with some of the best minds in software development
* I would get to work on a product that interested me
* My commute was shorter, they work an hour less than at CE (scheduled work hours, anyway), and their building was *amazing*

There were also a few cons though:

* I would be taking a considerable pay cut
* There was a lot of potential in the startup I was working for, and I was one of the *founders*
* Starting over on a codebase that I knew nothing about
* Change and growth is always hard, I was comfortable where I was!

After 10-ish days of really hard and careful consideration, I decided I was going to accept the apprenticeship! I told the company I was currently with and everyone was happy and excited for me, although I knew they were a little worried how they'd get by without me (hehe), and away I went! I started on September 1st and that brings us to now!

## To Now

So far, we're a couple weeks into the apprenticeship and I must say, I'm really liking the company! I wanted a few things from my last company that they weren't able to deliver, namely:

* A company-provided work machine
* More insight to the business
* And to work from home more (to kill my commute).

In the first week of this apprenticeship, I got all 3 of those things! So that was a huge check to the 'things I need from my company to be fully satisfied professionally' list.

#### How We Compare


There are 4 other apprentices and, for the most part, this is our first professional development job. So there have been some growing pains that we've experienced as first-time devs working in a shop with other people that some of the team has already been through, but it's been fun for everyone to help everyone else work out the issues. Everyone on the apprentice team has some strengths that they've been able to bring to the table, and there's a huge variety of skills! For example, one apprentice was a Javascript developer, one apprentice is absolutely spectacular at testing, another has amazing insight into the business, another has held a developer job before and has some previous experience, etc.

#### The Projects

I can't reveal any specific information (nor would you want someone revealing specific information about your business), but I can tell you a little bit about the projects we've been given so far and how our team dynamic has helped us in our tasks.

Most of the projects so far have been fairly simple and, if any of us had worked on them individually, we probably could have completed them really quickly. *But that's not the point of the apprenticeship*, and we knew that from previous talks with the people running it. So we all got together and talked out the problems and how to solve them.

The good part of this approach was that we always came to a solution for the problems! Everyone has a creative solution or two and we hash out all of the ideas and come to what we think is the best, then we implement it!

The bad part of this approach comes from what we have come to know as 'mob programming.' One person ends up doing the coding (because, really, only one person can do the coding), then the remaining four watch and provide feedback. This sounds great in theory, but having that many people work on the exact same thing is actually a little difficult. One person might not think as fast as the rest, or might be thinking about how to implement something in a different way, etc. Imagine multiple people using the same wood to build a single thing-- that's kind of what it's like.

#### The Second Week

In the second week, we got into our own group groove. We've been given projects that are a little bit harder, we've been given more than one project (so we're not all working on the exact same thing), and we tend to branch off into small little pairs or groups and, so far, that's working pretty well. The hard part is coming together with what we worked on so everyone can gain that knowledge, and we've talked about doing micro presentations on  what we did so everyone is on the same page. We haven't implemented this, but I'm sure I'll write another post about that!

## Thoughts So Far

The codebase is still a little intimidating to me because I don't know all of the products very well, and the pace is a liiiiittle slow (because the company **very strongly** encourages high-quality code), but my own personal learning style is to drink from the proverbial fire hydrant of knowledge, and I know not everyone is like that, so take that statement with a grain of salt. Also, my only previous professional development experience involved the sales people selling something, then the devs building it as fast as humanly possible, so maybe the slow pace is just MX doing things how they should be done!

Despite all of that, I'm really glad I took this apprenticeship. It's given me some *amazing* insight into my own development skills and some advanced techniques, I've already met some really amazing people who are incredibly talented, and when the leadership of this company talks to you, you can just *feel* their desire to help our customers and change the way the banking industry works. I'm always excited to go to work the next day and I absolutely cannot wait to see how much more I learn. It's absolutely amazing at MX.
